\section{Summary}

\section{Other Work}

As dictated by the Queen’s School of Computing, 25\% of the evaluation for CISC
500 is left to be arranged between the student and their supervisor. Given the
nature of this research, lab work or developing software appeared out of scope.
I believe that one of the benefits of applied research is its ability to take
abstract concepts and frameworks and show their utility in solving complicated
problems. This took the form of performing a lecture on the project's research
and the application of graphs in Dr. Robin Dawes’ CISC 235: Data Structures course.

\subsection{International Network for Social Network Analysis}

The findings and methodologies proposed in this thesis will be presented at the
International Network for Social Network Analysis' annual Sunbelt
conference in Paris, France.

\section{Future Work}

* better ANNs 
* different contexts (UK, US, Chile, France)
* more variables?
* more efficient way of fitting the model
