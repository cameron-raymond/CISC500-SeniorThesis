\begin{abstract}
  The advent of social media has enabled political elite to engage with the
  broader populous in new and unforeseen ways -- and the ability to bypass the
  traditional mediating forces of mass media allows for a more direct promotion
  of policy, ideology and party stances. This has prompted questions as to how
  different types of messages modulate the overall political discourse, and if
  certain categories of messages carry bridging or bonding characteristics.
  Drawing on Twitter data leading up to the 2019 Canadian Federal Election, the
  notion of engagement graphs are introduced and two novel, graph-based metrics
  of topic centrality  -- one which measures how central a topic was to the
  general discourse, and one which measures how central a topic was to a
  particular voting bloc -- are developed. Statistically significant variations
  in topic centrality are then shown, demonstrating the existence of bridging
  and bonding messages, and their implications for political polarization are
  discussed.

\section{Introduction}

The way information is distributed and received has changed significantly over
the past decade. As Cogburn and Espinoza-Vasquez argue, Barrack Obama’s 2008
presidential campaign was a watershed moment in social media campaigning – and
in the subsequent decade, from Macron to Brexit to the Five Star Movement,
social media has played an increasing role in how politics is conducted
\cite{manucci2018wind,cogburn2011networked}.  The same holds true for Canada,
between 2013 and 2018 the share of Canadian federal media expenditure spent on
digital advertising rose from 27\% to 65\%, a 140\% increase, making the study
of new media critical from a social science perspective
\cite{annualReportCanadaAdvertisingActivities_2018}. Over the past 12 years,
political elites have subverted traditional models of political communication by
using social media to directly promote various policies, topics and issues to
the electorate\footnote{The terms policy, issue and topic will be used
interchangeably to refer to categories of
messages.}\cite{mcnair2017introduction}.

Additionally, it is important to note that not all messages promoted by
political elites are likely to serve the same purpose. As Schipper and Woo note
— dog whistles, micro-targeting, and persuasion games are often a part of
electoral politics \cite{schipper2018political}. Some topics may be logistical
in nature, informing party affiliates of campaign events; other topics may be
promoted in an attempt to rally that party's core voting bloc; others, finally,
may be an attempt to attract engagement from new, untapped demographics
\cite{shah2007campaign}. The latter two categories are in many ways analogous to
Robert Putnam's conception of social capital, which Putnam describes as the idea
that ``social networks have value.'' \cite{putnam2000bowling}. Here, Putnam
draws the distinction between two forms of social capital: the bonding type,
which occurs within a group -- and the bridging type, which spans different
demographics \cite{putnam2000bowling}. Hofer and Aubert note that usage of
Twitter had some affect on perceived amounts of bridging social capital, and
Miller et al.'s findings suggest positive correlates between social media usage
and political activity \cite{hofer2013perceived,miller2015talking}. However, no
research has touched on how different types of messaging affect the bridging or
bonding capabilities of social media, and how this relates to political media.
Therefore, the research question being proposed is: are their data to support
the notion that some political messages are bonding in nature, rallying members
within a group, while other political messages are bridging in nature? This
question will be answered within the context of the 2019 Canadian Federal
Election with the tweets of Canada’s five major, english speaking party leaders:
Andrew Scheer, Elizabeth May, Jagmeet Singh, Justin Trudeau, and Maxime Bernier.


In order to answer this question, a justification of Canadian politics and
social media data in this context will be given. Then an overview of the data
collected and a formal definition of the political engagement graph used will
allow for the exploration of two measures of topic centrality: total network
topic centrality, and party leader topic centrality. Finally, results from this
process and a discussion of their implications will highlight possibilities for
future research.  

\subsection{Social Media in the Canadian Context}

While it is clear that technology is changing how information is received, and
thus also changing how politics is conducted, it may not be clear the role of
Canadian politics in this context. However, Canada’s political system is a
fertile environment to test the importance of political messaging, because
relative to most liberal democracies, it is dominated by party
politicians \cite{cross2004contours}. As Carty put it: 

\begin{quote}
  No obvious simple geographic reality, no common linguistic or religious
  homogeneity, no common revolutionary experience or unique historical moment
  animated [Canada] or gave it life. Canada was created when a coalition of party
  politicians deemed it to be in their interest to do so, and it has been
  continuously grown, reshaped and defended by its politicians.\cite{carty2010political}
\end{quote}

Thus, it is not surprising that Canada’s political system
encourages electoral pragmatism – and developed large, ``big tent'' parties that
are among the most organizationally weak and decentralized of established
democracies \cite{cross2004contours}. This system defines political parties as brokers of the often
conflicting, weakly integrated electorate –- as opposed to mobilizers of
distinct communities, articulating claims rooted in their pre-existing
interests. In this way, parties act as the ``principal instruments of national
accommodation, rather than democratic division'' \cite{carty2010political}.

The dominance of parties in Canadian politics, their amorphous ideological
stances, and the many intersectional geographic, linguistic and religious
cleavages have given birth to what’s been coined the brokerage party system
\cite{carty2010political}. The need to capture pluralities in a diverse range of
electoral districts means that most parties have to take stances on most issues,
and thus when a user engages with a specific issue, it doesn’t necessarily
invoke a specific party or vice versa \cite{franklin1992decline}. This makes Canada a preferable case
relative to systems with smaller, single-issue parties. The relative lack of
ideological constraints mean Canadian politicians are forced to decide when to
expand their voter base, risking fragmentation, and when to appeal to their
existing supporters, potentially segmenting off parts of the electorate
\cite{schipper2018political,franklin1992decline}. 

\subsection{Content as a ``First-Class Citizen''}

Given the utility of Canadian politics in answering questions about different
axes of political engagement, the question then is: how do we observe and
interrogate this landscape? Social media data, culled from platforms like
Twitter, are inherently relational -- and thus lend themselves well to being
represented as graphs. An empirical analysis that observes and measures how
users behave and engage with political elite online privileges this relational
aspect of social media. Social network analysis helps avoid the pitfalls of
survey data, famously described by Allen Barton as “a sociological meat grinder,
tearing the individual from [their] social context”
\cite{freeman2004development}. While there exists studies on user engagement in
social networks, online or otherwise, such research generally focuses on
connections between individuals (\emph{User A} is connected to \emph{User B})
and rarely acknowledges the context with which engagement occurs
\cite{Zhang2017FindingCU,kavanaugh2002community,hofer2013perceived,miller2015talking}.
In an online environment, certain users may engage with certain content
producers when they produce certain forms of content, but choose not to engage
with that same producer if the subject matter differs. As such, more nuanced
graph models are needed and developed that acknowledge the importance of the
producer of the content \emph{as well as the content itself} in shaping
engagement. Content holds an especially important role in online mediums, where
users have a granular ability to control what they expose themselves to. This
theoretical underpinning allows for a more nuanced analysis and in doing so
makes content a ``first-class citizen.''


\section{Methods}

\subsection{Data}

% Twitter data - %'s and stuff + ReTweet/Tweet graphs
The novel dataset used was collected via Twitter's historical search application
programming interface (API), which allows user's to programmatically access any
publicly available tweet. The API was used to collect all of the
English\footnote{Denoted by a language marker in the historical search API.}
tweets from Canada's five, English speaking party leaders: Andrew Scheer,
Elizabeth May, Jagmeet Singh, Justin Trudeau, and Maxime Bernier. The timeframe
of collection ranges from October 21, 2018 to October 21, 2019 -- the eve of
Canada’s federal election. While the tweets from each Federal party’s official
Twitter accounts were also collected, they predominantly acted as logistical
tools – informing party affiliates of events and rallies. The personal accounts
for party leaders were generally more pertinent to their beliefs, platforms and
style of rhetoric, and thus are better suited to analyze the bridging versus
bonding nature of various topics. In this spirit, only tweets of the party
leader were used, excluding retweets. Figure \ref{fig:tweets_over_time}
visualizes the daily and cumulative number of tweets over time, in aggregate and
by party leader, resulting in 7,978 total tweets. Additionally, for each tweet collected from a party leader, all of the available
retweets by general users\footnote{The term general users will denote those
active on Twitter who are not party leaders.} were collected for a total of
113,293 retweets by 36,450 general users. This is, again, visualized in
aggregate and by party leader in Figure \ref{fig:retweets_over_time}.

\begin{figure}[h!]

  \caption[Daily and Cumulative Retweets over Time]{Daily and Cumulative Retweets over Time}
  \label{fig:retweets_over_time}
\end{figure}

Given the inherent noise and extraneous info in text data, it is
standard and necessary to preprocess text before modeling
\cite{sapul2017trending}. The text cleaning pipeline removes punctuation marks,
stop words, words with fewer than three characters, and URLs, as well as common
Twitter symbols like ``RT:'', ``@'' and ``\#''. Emojis were converted to text
using the python package \texttt{emoji}. After this process, all text was
converted to lower-case and lemmatized to get rid of common suffixes. Therefore,
the tweet in Figure \ref{fig:tweet_ex} after preprocessing reads: \emph{wherever
maple leaf fly represents rich history bright future value hold dear happy flag
day canada}.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Engagement Graph}

The networks considered in this paper are connected, unweighted, and undirected.
Let $(V,E)$ be a network, where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ is the set of
edges. If vertex $v_1$ is connected to vertex $v_2$, it is denoted by
$(v_1,v_2)\in E$. Engagement graph's are defined with additional constraints
that denote three categories of vertices: those that \emph{produce objects}
(Tweets, songs, goods, services, \etc), those that represent the objects
produced, and a third set of vertices that chooses to engage with the various
produced objects in the network. In this context the engagement graph represents
the tweets that party leaders produce, and the general users who choose which
tweets to engage with. An example of this type of political engagement graph is
shown in Figure \ref{fig:ex_engagement_graph}. More formally, the political
engagement graph is defined below:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Vertices}: Let $V_{1}=\{v_{1},v_{2},\dots\}$ be the set of
  party leaders; $V_{2}=\{v_{1},v_{2},\dots\}$ be the set of tweets by the
  party leaders; and let
  $V_{3}=\{v_{1},v_{2},\dots\}$ be the set of ``general users'' who
  retweet tweets. Let the total set of vertices $V=V_{1}\cup V_{2}\cup V_{3}$.
  
  \item \emph{Edges}: Let $E$ be the set of edges. Allow the edge $(v_{1},
  v_{2})\in E$ if and only if $v_{1}\in V_{1}, v_{2}\in V_{2}$ or $v_{1}\in
  V_{3}, v_{2}\in V_{2}$. By this definition, we will only allow edges from a
  party leader vertex to a tweet vertex, or from a generic user vertex to a
  tweet vertex.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.2]{figures/ex_engagement_graph}
  \caption[Example Engagement Graph]{Example Engagement Graph}
  \label{fig:ex_engagement_graph}
\end{figure}

Further nuances can be added to distinguish between different types of objects,
which in this context would refer to tweets of different topics. Figure
\ref{fig:engagement_graph_no_topics}  visualizes the full political engagement
graph collected with all 5 party leaders, 7,978 tweets, 36,450 general users,
and 113,293 retweets\footnote{The number of retweets is equivalent to the number
of edges from tweet vertices to general user vertices.} built with these constraints.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Topic Modeling}

In order to evaluate the bridging and bonding characteristics of various
political messages on Twitter, the tweets collected must first be organized by
topic. Given the size of the data, manually coding each label is inefficient as
well as subject to individual biases. As a result, there is a need for
techniques that autonomously organize big, unclassified corpuses of text. 

Topic modeling methods find clusters of words that frequently occur together
(topics), connects words with similar meanings, and distinguishes different uses
of words with multiple meanings \cite{alghamdi2015survey}. This is based on the
underlying assumption that a document is concerned with a fixed set of topics,
and that the frequency of words used is indicative of this latent structure
\cite{blei2003latent}. Given that topic extraction approaches based on keywords
are brittle, context specific and are unable to capture emergent topics --
unsupervised machine learning techniques, like the latent Dirichlet allocation
(LDA) developed by Blei et al., are especially useful for autonomous topic
extraction. An LDA model defines two distributions -- one which models topics as
``a distribution over a fixed vocabulary of terms,'' and another which models
documents as a distribution of topics based on the occurrences of words in each
document, the topic distribution per word and the importance of words to each
topic \cite{blei2003latent}. The LDA requires four inputs: the text corpus --
which in this context are the cleaned tweets from all 5 party leaders; $\alpha$
-- which acts as a concentration parameter for how documents are modeled as
topics; $\beta$ -- which acts as a concentration parameter for how topics are
modeled as words; and $k$ -- which is the number of topics to be modeled
\cite{blei2003latent}.

  \begin{tabular}{cc}

  \end{tabular}
  \caption[LDA Parameter Sweep Results]{LDA Parameter Sweep Results}
  \label{fig:lda_param_sweep}
\end{figure}

By performing a parameter sweep, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ lie on the interval
$[0, 1]$ with increments of 0.05, and $k$ ranging from 4 and 7, various LDAs
were exposed to the entire corpus of tweets and then evaluated using $c\_v$
coherence. Figure \ref{fig:lda_param_sweep} shows, for each $k$ value, the
$c\_v$ coherence as a function of different combinations of $\alpha$ and
$\beta$. The most performant model had a $k$ value of 7, $\alpha$ of 0.31 and
$\beta$ of 0.81 and a $c\_v$ coherence score of 0.48. By labelling each tweet as
the maximum probability value in its topic mixture, each tweet was assigned a
single topic. The word clouds for each topic are described in Figure
\ref{fig:topic_word_clouds}.

\begin{figure}[h!]

    \begin{tabular}{cccc}
    \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{Figures/topic_1_wordcloud} &
    \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{Figures/topic_2_wordcloud} &

    \end{tabular}
    \caption[LDA Topic Word Clouds]{LDA Topic Word Clouds}
    \label{fig:topic_word_clouds}
\end{figure}

Topic 1 pertained to campaign messages, rallies and logistics – and makes up
8.2\% of all tweets. Topic 2 contains tweets regarding a carbon tax, pipelines
and the economy – and makes up 16.3\% of all tweets. Topic 3 contains tweets
about the SNC Lavalin affair, a scandal that plagued Justin Trudeau, and tweets
about corruption – making up 18\% of all tweets. Topic 4 is predominantly
appeals to the middle-class and economy – and is 29.7\% of all tweets. Topic 5
contains celebratory messages about the campaign, as well as tweets regarding
national holidays and days of remembrance – and make up 15\% of all tweets.
Topic 6 is made up of tweets about immigration, diversity and free speech – and
makes up 11.5\% of all tweets. Finally, topic 7 contains tweets regarding
healthcare, abortion and pharmacare – and makes up 1\% of all tweets. The
magnitude of how many tweets were assigned to each topic is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:topic_distribution}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{cc}
    \includegraphics[width=0.40\textwidth]{Figures/topic_distribution} &
    \includegraphics[width=0.60\textwidth]{Figures/grouped_bar_by_pl_topic} \\
  (a) Topic Breakdown & (b) Number of Tweets per Topic by Party Leader \\[6pt]
  \end{tabular}
  \caption[LDA Topic Distribution]{LDA Topic Distribution}
  \label{fig:topic_distribution}
\end{figure}

As can be seen by part (b) of Figure \ref{fig:topic_distribution} -- while Topic
6, tweets pertaining to diversity and immigration, only made up 11.5\% of all
Tweets they made up the majority of Maxime Bernier's. This signals an attempt on
his part to bring these topics to the forefront of the debate despite few other
party leader's broaching the topic. Additionally, Andrew Scheer and Elizabeth
May's campaigns relied heavily on topic 3, the SNC Lavalin affair, with a
disproportionate number of tweets aimed at Justin Trudeau's handling of the
affair. Finally, it can be noted that Maxime Bernier and Andrew Scheer also had
a disproportionate number of tweets pertaining to topic 2 -- rebutting Justin
Trudeau's plan to implement a carbon tax, and arguing for greater access to
Alberta's Oil Sands. In Schipper and Woo's model for political messaging, an
initial assumption is that each party leader tailors their messages to appeal
to various demographics; however, that remains to be seen without a more
rigorous analysis of how the electorate engage with each category of message
\cite{schipper2018political}. By assigning each tweet vertex to a topic and then
coloring the tweet vertices accordingly, the full engagement graph (Figure
\ref{fig:engagement_graph}) for online political content is complete and ready
for analysis.

  \label{fig:engagement_graph}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Topic Centrality}

Descriptive figures like Figure \ref{fig:topic_distribution} show the frequency
with which tweets of different topics were promoted by Canadian party leaders
leading up to a major election. However, these Figures say little about how
different policies rallied groups of existing supporters, or bridged different
voting blocs. In order to answer such questions – the metric eigenvector
centrality is expanded upon. The result are two variations of topic centrality:
total network topic centrality and party leader topic centrality. By juxtaposing
the two, various insights about how different topics influenced discourse can be
derived.

\subsubsection{Eigenvector Centrality}

Research concerning the centrality of vertices in a graph have successfully been
applied to problems in marketing, economics and epidemiology; Stephenson and
Zelen explored the utility of centrality measures in studying the social
dynamics of Gelada baboons \cite{stephenson1989rethinking}. Common centrality
measures include measures of degree and betweenness. This article will focus on
the notion that central vertices are close to other central vertices, which is
one of the founding intuitions behind Google’s “page-rank” algorithm and
eigenvector centrality.

As Newman lays out in his 2016, Mathematics of Networks: ``the eigenvector
centrality [\dots] accords each vertex a centrality that depends both on the
number and the quality of its connections: having a large number of connections
still counts for something, but a vertex with a smaller number of high-quality
contacts may outrank one with a larger number of mediocre contacts.''
\cite{newman2008mathematics} The eigencentrality of vertex $i$ given an
adjacency matrix $A$ is defined as $x_i$ where $x_i$ is proportional to the
average eigenvector centrality of $i$’s neighbors:

\begin{equation}
  x_i=\frac{1}{\lambda}\sum_{j=1}^{n}A_{ij}x_j
\end{equation}

where $\lambda$ is some constant. By defining the vector of centralities as
$\vec{x} = (x_1,x_2,\dots)$ this equation can be rewritten as $\lambda \vec{x} =
A \cdot \vec{x}$, and it is evident that $\vec{x}$ is an eigenvector of the
adjacency matrix with eigenvalue $\lambda$ \cite{newman2008mathematics}. By
Perron-Frobenius theorem, picking the largest eigenvalue of $A$ will result in
all elements of $\vec{x}$ being non-negative \cite{newman2008mathematics}.

\subsubsection{Total Network Topic Centrality}

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{cc}
    \includegraphics[width=0.40\textwidth]{Figures/engagement_graph} &
    \includegraphics[width=0.40\textwidth]{Figures/jagmeet_singh_subgraph} \\
  (a) Full Engagement Graph & (b) Political Engagement Subgraph for Jagmeet Singh\\[6pt]
  \end{tabular}
  \caption[Example Engagement Graph and Subgraph]{Example Engagement Graph and Subgraph}
  \label{fig:engagment_and_subgraph}
\end{figure}

Total network topic centrality is an aggregate of the eigenvector centrality of
all tweets of a certain topic in the entire engagement graph. For reference,
this graph has been reproduced in part (a) of Figure \ref{fig:engagment_and_subgraph}. More formally,
and with slight abuse of notation, the total network topic centrality of topic
$t$, $T_{t}$, can be defined as the set of all eigenvector centrality measures for tweet
vertices of topic $t$ in a graph $G$. 

\begin{equation}
  T_{t} := \{ x_i , \forall i \in G \mid type(i)=tweet, topic(i)=t \}
\end{equation}

When taking the aggregate (sum, mean, z-score relative to other topics), a
single number can be assigned to the relative importance of topic $t$. And in
keeping with the strengths of eigenvector centrality, $T_{t}$ will be larger if:
those tweets are retweeted a lot, and if they're retweeted by \emph{highly
engaged} users. This is a desirable aspect as highly engaged users are more
likely  share content, attend a political rally and vote
\cite{miller2015talking}. Therefore, total network topic centrality provides a
nuanced metric for how central different issues were to the entire online
discourse. 

\subsubsection{Party Leader Topic Centrality}

In order to measure how central a topic is to a party leader's base, party
leader topic centrality was developed. This assumes a world in which party
leader $j$ is the only actor with which general users can engage with. This is
done by taking a subgraph of $G$ -- $G_{j}$ -- which only contains party leader
$j$, all of $j$'s tweets, $I$, and all edges from $i\in I$ to the general users
who retweeted one of $j$'s tweets. An example of this is in part (b) of Figure
\ref{fig:engagment_and_subgraph}, which demonstrates the subgraph for Jagmeet
Singh. 

After the subgraph $G_j$ is constructed, the party leader topic
centrality $P_{tj}$ is defined as the set of all eigenvector centrality measures
for tweet vertices of topic $t$ in a graph $G_{j}$.

\begin{equation}
    P_{tj} := \{ x_i ,  \forall i \in G_{j} \mid type(i)=tweet, topic(i)=t \}
\end{equation}

Similarly, by taking the aggregate of $P_{tj}$ a single centrality score can be
assigned that measures how important topic $t$ was to those who engaged with
that party leader. This will be higher if it: has a high number of retweets
and  retweeted by $j$'s \emph{most engaged followers}. Highly engaged users who
rarely engage with that specific party leader are therefore discounted in this
metric relative to someone who is less engaged, but concentrates their attention
on that party leader's content. 

\section{Results}

After calculating $\textbf{T}=\{T_{t}, \forall t \in topics\}$\footnote{$topics$
refers to the seven topics that tweets could be assigned to.} and
$\textbf{P}=\{P_{tj}, \forall t \in topics,\forall j \in
party\_leaders\}$\footnote{$party\_leaders$ refers to the five Canadian Federal
party leaders whose tweets were collected.}, each individual centrality measure,
$T_{t} \in \textbf{T}$ and $P_{tj}\in \textbf{P}$, can be summated
($\hat{T_{t}}$/$\hat{P_{tj}}$), have it's mean calculated
($\overline{T}_{t}$/$\overline{P}_{tj}$), or have it's z-score taken relative to
other topics in its set\footnote{For the party leader topic centrality, the
z-score of topic centrality is based off of other tweet topics for that party
leader.} ($\stackrel{z}{T}_{t}$/$\stackrel{z}{P}_{tj}$).

Figure \ref{fig:topic_centrality} shows plots of $\textbf{T}$ as a function of
$\textbf{P}$; each point is colored according to its party leader and is
annotated with the topic that it pertains to. The x-axis is the party leader
topic centrality score for all party leader and topic combinations -- and the
y-axis is the total network topic centrality score for each topic\footnote{This
explains why all party leader topic centrality scores for the same topic lie on
the same point on the y-axis.}.

Some initial insights from comparing \textbf{$\hat{T}$} by \textbf{$\hat{P}$}
with \textbf{$\overline{T}$} by \textbf{$\overline{P}$}; while Maxime Bernier
promoted a large number of tweets regarding immigration, free speech and
diversity as indicated by a high $\hat{P}_{6M}$ -- these tweets gained little
traction overall in the entire network ($\stackrel{z}{T_{6}}$) as well as
compared to other topics Bernier tweeted about ()$\stackrel{z}{P}_{6M}$).
Additionally, despite the relatively few tweets pertaining to health care and
pharmacare (topic 7), and the low total network centrality score
($\stackrel{z}{T_{7}}$), they were disproportionately important to Justin
Trudeau's network ($\stackrel{z}{P}_{7T}$). Discrepancies in a topic that gives
the highest $\hat{P_{tj}}$ for a party leader (total topic engagement) and
$\overline{P}_{tj}$  (mean topic engagement) can illustrate inefficiencies in
connecting with their target demographic.

As well, for each topic -- the party leader topic centrality score can be
averaged across all the different party leaders to give a more general analysis
of how central topics were to the entire network, or to any individual party
leader. This is shown in Figure \ref{fig:topic_centrality_combined}. Here it is
most insightful to look at \textbf{$\stackrel{z}{T}$} by
\textbf{$\stackrel{z}{P}$}, specifically in the lower right-hand quadrant and
upper left-hand quadrant. The former indicates tweet topics that are more
important to a party leader's base than to the entire network (topics 7, 4 and
1). Topic 1 -- campaign dynamics -- intuitively makes sense in this category; it
is not surprising that messages about the campaign, where rallies are, \etc
would appeal more to a party leader's base than to the entire network.
Conversely, tweets in the upper left-hand quadrant indicates tweet topics that
are more important to the overall network than to the individual network --
which may be an indication of those topics spanning partisan divides (topics 2
and 3).

% STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE
\section{Discussion}

While not a perfect proxy, topics that are more central to any individual party
leader than to the overall discourse appear to serve as ``bonding messages''
which are meant to rally a party leader's base. These tended to be topics that
were most pertinent to supporters of a party leader (logistical information,
campaign information, \etc). Conversely, topics that are more central to the
total network than any party leader tended to be pervasive in the public
discourse. 

% RELATE BACK TO PUTNAM -> Talk about how bridging topics != hunky dory kind of
% discourse. Things can bridge party divides in toxic ways.
