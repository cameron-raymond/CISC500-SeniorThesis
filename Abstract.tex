The advent of social media has enabled political parties to engage with the
broader populous in new and unforeseen ways. This, coupled with rising levels of
political polarization has prompted debates as to whether people care about
policy anymore, or if they self-select into political bubbles online based on
their chosen party leader. This thesis proposes a novel adaptation of stochastic
blockmodelling to measure the degree to which political engagement on Twitter
was driven by policy or party leaders. Building on a graph theoretical approach,
measures of topic centrality are developed to give a measurement for how
efficient topics were at either spanning party leaders' bases, or appealing to
them. This is done in the context of Canada's 2019 federal election.
